# multilabel-road-weather-detection
Different types of weathers can significantly affect the response and performance of drivers, either positively or negatively. For example, foggy weather conditions impede drivers’ visibility and can lead to road incidents or accidents. Researchers in the transport community are exploring artificial intelligence to understand the impact of weather conditions on road safety, develop weather detection systems, and design driver assistance systems to support drivers in adverse conditions. One of the goals is to identify driver’s distraction levels associated with different types of weather. Weather detection also plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems to secure overall safety and smooth running of the transport network. This research aims at investigating the use of meta learning, attention mechanisms and data representation approaches to improve deep learning identification of four different types of weather.
In this project, we report the results of different loss functions and data enhancements to improve deep learning weather detection. Results show that introducing dynamic weighted loss function and different data augmentation techniques can significantly improve the model’s performance.
